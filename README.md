With the growing competition in healthcare industries, businesses in the healthcare sector need to stand out. Leap ahead by leveraging next-gen enterprise technology. UnitCare ERP is an open-source solution for healthcare that will help you maintain all critical data under one roof.


### Patient Repository

In UnitCare ERP, you can create a patient file for any individual who receives your healthcare services. Save important information for every patient. With ERPNext's integrated system, all data will be accessible to everyone in one place.

### Healthcare Practitioners

UnitCare ERP lets you create multiple practitioners (doctors, nurses, etc.) and link each one to their appropriate access permissions. You can also link each person to their employee documents, which lets employees access their leaves, payroll, and other HR data.

### Practitioner Schedule

ERP UnitCare's Physician Schedule will help you configure the availability of healthcare practitioners. Set each person's days and timings, then the system will block patient appointments within each practitioner's schedule.

### Patient Appointments

With complete visibility of every practitioner's schedule, there's no chance of double-booking appointment slots. You can even automate notification emails to be sent as soon as a patient books a consultation.

### Document Storage

Doctors need to maintain various reports, notes and information for each patient. Instead of dealing with third-party storage apps, use UnitCare ERP's file attachments to store multimedia documents of any format â€” from text, PDFs, and reports to images or videos. This ensures that the patient record reflects all pertinent information.
